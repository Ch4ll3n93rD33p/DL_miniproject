# DL_miniproject
Miniproject 2 for the Deep Learning class at UNIGE  

The file input.txt contains the Shakespear dataset.  
The project can be found in the jupyter notebook miniproject2\_language\_model.ipynb

The file cross-entropy_graph_xsteps.png is the graph of the cross-entropy loss over the trainig steps for the model trained for x steps.  
The file completion_xsteps.txt containes exemple outputs for the text generations with the model trained for x steps.  

I also save the models state dict after the trainig in files named model_xsteps.pth, but due to theire sizes I am unable to to put them on github.
